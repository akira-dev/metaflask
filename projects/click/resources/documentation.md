# Documentation

The documentation for click exists in two places:

* the sources of the documentation are in the click repository itself.
* the theme for the online documentation and the build scripts
  for that are living in the flask-docs repository.

For an overview of how this works refer to the flask-docs repository
on the pocoo project:
