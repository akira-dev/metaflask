Flask JSON-RPC
==============

A basic JSON-RPC implementation for your Flask-powered sites based on `django-json-rpc <https://github.com/samuraisam/django-json-rpc>`_.

Some reasons you might want to use:

* Simple, powerful, flexible and pythoic API.
* Support python 2.7, `3.3 or later <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/python3/#python3-support>`_
* The Web browseable API.
* Support for authentication.
* Proxy to test your JSON Service.
* Run-time type checking.
* Extensive documentation, and great community support.

For support python 2.6.5+ or earlier use the branch `py2k <https://github.com/cenobites/flask-jsonrpc/tree/py2k>`_.

There is a live example API for testing purposes, `available here <http://flask-jsonrpc.herokuapp.com/api/browse>`_.
