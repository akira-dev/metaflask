Flask-User
==========

Customizable User Account Management for Flask
----------------------------------------------

So you're writing a Flask web application and would like to authenticate your users.
You start with a simple Login page, but soon enough you need to handle:

* Registrations and Email Confirmations
* Change Usernames, Change Passwords, and Forgotten Passwords

And wouldn't it be nice to also offer:

* Role-based Authorization
* Remember-me cookies
* Multiple emails per user
* Internationalization

Flask-User offers these user features (and more) out-of-the-box
while also honoring the following developer needs:

* Reliable (Code coverage of over 95%)
* Secure (Built on top of widely deployed Flask-Login)
* Ready to use (Through sensible defaults)
* Largely configurable (Through configuration settings)
* Fully customizable (Through customizable functions and email templates)
* Well documented
* Tested on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4
