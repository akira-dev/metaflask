JINJA2

The Jinja2 project is an implementation of a template engine for Python
that is largely inspired by an old version of Django but departed into a
very different direction.  It is being used by Flask, the Sphinx documentation
tool and many other libraries.

Currently Jinja2 is mainly centrally managed by Armin Ronacher but this
should open up a bit more over time.
